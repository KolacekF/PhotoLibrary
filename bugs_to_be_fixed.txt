index_photos.py doesnt take path with spaces
with promts inside command line, write "press any key to continue..." & drag .db file and press any key...
in create_html.py, in command line you have to be in working directory. Would be better if it would be fixed 
Could be written some kind of helper script, that could be triggering index_photos.py and then create_html.py
